# COGNITION FUTURES
**Cognition Futures** is a new research team within Orthogonal Research and Education Laboratory (OREL). We focus on computational models of intelligent agents with emphasis on the developmental/evolution, embodied behavior, and allostasis of these systems. We are also interested in the historical and philosophical underpinning cognitive science, particular the epistemic trajectories that have lead to current fields of academic inquiry. This will lead us to an understanding of why intelligent systems and associated algorithms look the way they do, and how they can be improved upon in the future.
